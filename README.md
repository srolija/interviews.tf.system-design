# IaC for System Design

Solution based on following guides:
- https://medium.com/avmconsulting-blog/how-to-deploy-a-dockerised-node-js-application-on-aws-ecs-with-terraform-3e6bceb48785
- https://hceris.com/provisioning-an-application-load-balancer-with-terraform/

Due to scope Route53 for Zone and ECR are not part of the IaC, so they are hard-coded.
